**Reporting & Automation - 5. User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**

User-Defined Functions (UDFs) extend Excel's capabilities by creating custom Python functions that work like native Excel functions such as `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, or `VLOOKUP`. These functions enable complex calculations and custom logic to be embedded directly in your spreadsheet formulas.

To create UDFs in Python for Excel, define functions within a `=PY()` cell and call them using Excel cell references or table names through the `xl()` function. For example, a formula might look like `=PY(MY_PYTHON_FUNCTION(xl("A1"), xl("MyTable[#All]" , headers=True)))`.

When you use this approach, the formula in Excel will look like `=PY(MY_PYTHON_FUNCTION(xl("A1"), xl("MyTable[#All]" , headers=True)))`. The Python code within the `=PY()` cell defines `MY_PYTHON_FUNCTION`.

**Step 1: Generate Sample Data (Optional but useful for a UDF that uses a range)**

For this demonstration, we'll generate a simple sales list. A UDF *can* operate on simple scalar values (like converting units), but it can also take Excel ranges or Table names as arguments using the `xl()` function *inside* the UDF. Let's create data for the latter case.

In a new Excel cell, enter `=PY` and paste the following code, then press **Ctrl+Enter**:

```python
# Generate dummy sales data for UDF example
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from faker import Faker
import random

fake = Faker()

num_records = 500

data = {
    'OrderID': range(1001, 1001 + num_records),
    'Product': [fake.word() for _ in range(num_records)],
    'Amount': [round(random.uniform(20, 1000), 2) for _ in range(num_records)],
    'Quantity': [random.randint(1, 15) for _ in range(num_records)]
}

df_udf_data = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Add some missing values
missing_indices = random.sample(range(num_records), int(num_records * 0.03)) # 3% missing
df_udf_data.loc[missing_indices, 'Amount'] = np.nan


df_udf_data # Output the DataFrame
```

Let's assume this data is placed in a range or Table named `UDFSalesData`.
**Step 2: Write the Python Code for the Custom Functions within a `=PY()` Cell**

Now, you will write the Python code for your UDF(s). **Each UDF should be placed within its *own* `=PY` cell.**. You can define multiple functions in one cell if they are related.

In a **new** Excel cell, enter `=PY` and paste the following code, then press **Ctrl+Enter**. This cell will *define* the functions, but won't return a value unless you explicitly call one at the end.

**Example 1: Simple UDF (Scalar Input)**

This UDF takes a temperature in Fahrenheit and converts it to Celsius.

In a **new** Excel cell, enter `=PY` and paste the following code, then press **Ctrl+Enter**:

```python
# UDF: Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius

def CONVERTTOCELSIUS(fahrenheit):
    """
    Converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

    Args:
        fahrenheit (float): The temperature in Fahrenheit.

    Returns:
        float: The temperature in Celsius.
    """
    try:
        # Ensure input is numeric, handle potential Excel errors/types
        f = float(fahrenheit)
        return (f - 32) * 5/9
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        # Return a specific error indicator or handle as needed
        return "Invalid Input"
# This cell only defines functions; it doesn't produce a direct output unless you call a function here.
# You will call these functions from *other* =PY() cells in your worksheet.
```

**Explanation:**

*   The function `CONVERTTOCELSIUS` takes one argument, `fahrenheit`.
*   Inside the function, standard Python calculation is performed.
*   A `try...except` block is included to gracefully handle cases where the input from Excel is not a valid number, preventing a full Python error in Excel.
*   The `return` value is what appears in the Excel cell where the UDF is used.


**Example 2: UDF using `xl()` (Range/Table Input)**

This UDF takes an Excel range or Table name as input (passed as a string) and calculates the average sales amount from the 'Amount' column within that range/Table.

In a **separate, new** Excel cell, enter `=PY` and paste the following code, then press **Ctrl+Enter**:

```python
# UDF: Calculate Average Sales Amount from a range/Table

def GETAVERAGESALES(data_df):    """
    Calculates the average 'Amount' from a pandas DataFrame.

    Args:
        data_df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing the sales data.

    Returns:
        float or str: The average sales amount, or an error message if calculation fails.
    """
    # Input 'data_df' here will be the actual DataFrame loaded by xl("DataSource")
    try:
        # Ensure 'Amount' column exists and is numeric
        if 'Amount' not in data_df.columns:
            return f"Error: 'Amount' column not found in the provided data"

        # Convert 'Amount' to numeric, coercing errors to NaN
        data_df['Amount'] = pd.to_numeric(data_df['Amount'], errors='coerce')

        # Calculate the average, ignoring NaNs
        average_amount = data_df['Amount'].mean()

        if pd.isna(average_amount):
             return "Error: No valid numeric data in 'Amount' column"

        return round(average_amount, 2) # Return the rounded average

    except Exception as e:
        # Catch any other errors during processing
        return f"Processing Error: {e}"
# This cell only defines functions; it doesn't produce a direct output unless you call a function here.
# You will call these functions from *other* =PY() cells in your worksheet.
```

**Explanation:**

*   We define standard Python functions (`CONVERTTOCELSIUS`, `GETAVERAGESALES`).
*   These functions reside within a single `=PY()` cell. When this cell is executed, the functions are defined in the Python session associated with your workbook.
*   The docstrings still provide helpful information.
*   Error handling is included within the functions to manage invalid inputs or data issues.

**Step 3: Use the Custom Functions from Other `=PY()` Cells in Excel**

Now that the functions are defined in the Python session (by running the `=PY()` cell in Step 2), you can call them from *other* `=PY()` cells in your worksheet. You pass the Excel cell or range/Table you want to use as input *into* the `xl()` function, and then pass the result of `xl()` to your Python function.

1.  **For `CONVERTTOCELSIUS`:**
    *  Type a Fahrenheit temperature in a cell, say `C1` (e.g., `75`).
    *  In another cell, say `C2`, type the formula `=PY( CONVERTTOCELSIUS(xl("C1")) )`.
    *  Press **Ctrl+Enter**. The cell `C2` should show the Celsius equivalent (23.89).
    *  Change the value in `C1` and re-run the `C2` cell (Ctrl+Enter). It will recalculate.
    *  Try entering non-numeric text in `C1` and re-run `C2`. `C2` should show "Invalid Input".

2.  **For `GETAVERAGESALES`:**
    *  Ensure your dummy sales data from Step 1 is in a range or Table named `UDFSalesData` (or whatever name you used).
    *   In a new cell, type the formula `=PY( GETAVERAGESALES(xl("UDFSalesData[#All]", headers=True)) )`.
    *  Press **Ctrl+Enter**. The cell should display the calculated average sales amount from the 'Amount' column of your dummy data.
    *  If you change amounts in your `UDFSalesData` table and re-run the cell with the formula (Ctrl+Enter), the result should update.

**Important Notes on UDFs:**

*   **Recalculation:** Python UDFs recalculate whenever their input cells change or the sheet is recalculated.
*   **Performance:** Complex calculations on large datasets within a UDF can make your spreadsheet slow, as Excel waits for Python to return a result. For heavy analysis, it's often better to use a standard `=PY(...)` block to perform the analysis once and spill the results, rather than having many UDF calls throughout the sheet.
*   **Side Effects:** UDFs are designed to return a value to the cell they are in. They should *not* be used to modify other cells, open files, or perform other actions with side effects.
*   **Errors:** If a UDF encounters a Python error, the cell will typically show `#VALUE!`. You can right-click the cell and select "Show Error Details..." to see the Python traceback and debug.
*   **Availability:** The UDFs are available in the workbook as long as the Python session initiated by the `=PY` cell containing the definition is active.
